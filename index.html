    <h1>WFS 2.0 (ISO 19142:2010) Conformance Test Suite</h1>

    <p>This executable test suite checks Web Feature Service (WFS) 2.0 implementations 
    for conformance to ISO 19142:2010, <em>Geographic information -- Web Feature Service</em> 
    (also published as <a target="_blank" href="http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=39967">OGC 
    09-025r1</a>). Four fundamental conformance levels are covered by the test suite:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Simple WFS</strong>: Implements the following operations: GetCapabilities, 
    DescribeFeatureType, ListStoredQueries, DescribeStoredQueries, and the 
    GetFeature operation with at least the StoredQuery action (GetFeatureById).</li>
      <li><strong>Basic WFS</strong>: As for <strong>Simple WFS</strong>, plus the 
    GetFeature operation with the Query action and the GetPropertyValue operation.</li>
      <li><strong>Transactional WFS</strong>: As for <strong>Basic WFS</strong>, 
    plus the Transaction operation.</li>
      <li><strong>Locking WFS</strong>: As for <strong>Transactional WFS</strong>, 
    plus at least one of the GetFeatureWithLock or LockFeature operations.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The test suite is schema-aware in the sense that the WFS under test does 
    not need to support any particular application schema or to be loaded with 
    specialized test data. However, the following preconditions must be satisfied:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The GML application schema meets the requirements of the GML conformance 
    class <em>GML application schemas defining features and feature collections</em> 
    (ISO 19136, A.1.4).</li>
      <li>Data are available for at least one feature type advertised in the 
    capabilities document.</li>
    </ul>
